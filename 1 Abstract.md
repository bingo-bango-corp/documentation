# Bingo Bango

With Bingo Bango you can get anything you want delievered to you by people in your community.

As a hyperlocal, community-driven delivery service, Bingo Bango goes beyond traditional food delivery by dropping the ability to select items from menus. Open the app, and you can do two things: Get stuff, or make money. As a requester, you describe your desired item, describe your location, and select a "tip" that you will pay on top of the item's price. As a moneymaker, you see nearby jobs, assign yourself to them, fetch the desired item from anywhere and deliver it to the requester — in return receiving that beforementioned tip in addition to the price for the item itself. 

Bingo Bango does not care what you want or where you want it. Sitting on a hill in a park and in need of a cool beer? Bingo Bango — someone will go get them for you. In need of some office supplies, but that important meeting is coming up? Bingo Bango — someone will fetch them for you. Really stressed out about your bachelors and no time to commit to meeting a friend? Bingo Bango — someone is probably up for giving you a hug in return for a few bucks.

It's like Deliveroo, but for anything. It's like Amazon Fresh, but faster. It's like Lieferando, but also for anything and also faster and also the app looks good.

# This is a real app. It's not a concept, or a prototype, or a proof of concept. It's a real, working, production-ready web service that could serve millions of concurrent users worldwide.

## It all started with a Slack message

A few months ago, one of my coworkers, Dennis, requested "some lunch, really, anything is fine" on our team slack. "Just bring me something if you're going out for lunch, I'll pay you back + 2 bucks on top." 

Brandon, another coworker, swiftly responded: "☝ That should be an app." 

Me, very quickly realizing it's potential, immediately chimed in with "Brandon, delete this". And so he did. The following weekend, Bingo Bango was born.

## Service Thinking

My Thesis, [Service Thinking](https://service-thinking.jason-e.dev/) is about finding an approach for designing and conceptualizing services on a high level, applying common patterns from fields such as User Experince design and Software Engineering. Presented with the challenge of conceptualizing, designing and building a full service from scratch in such a short time, I had to define a suitable MVP first. After this, I frequently applied patterns presented in my thesis throughout the design and development processes — most notably the elevation of shared constants and components within the architecture in order to avoid duplication.
