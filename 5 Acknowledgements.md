# Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank [Brandon Oxendine](https://www.brandonoxendine.com/) for pretty much UI designing Bingo Bango in its entirety. And for sketching the wizard.

I'd like to thank [Morgan Brown](https://mhgbrown.is/) for reviewing my shoddy code.

I'd like to thank Finn for naming the wizard Bartholomeus Bong.

I'd like to thank my supervisor [Steffen Klaue](https://www.steffenklaue.com/) for guiding the project and understanding my being way too busy.

I'd also like to say thanks to all my colleagues at [Grover](https://www.grover.com/) that every day expand my horizons in any imaginable field of product development.

And lastly, I'd like to note my huge gratitude for the open source community - notably [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803), the creator of Vue.js, [Luca Ban](https://github.com/mesqueeb), the creator of vuex-easy-firestore, and [Jeff Delaney](https://github.com/codediodeio), the creator of geofirex. Even though it's probably hardly worth anything, I've commited to developing Bingo Bango as an open source project under the GNU General Public License.
